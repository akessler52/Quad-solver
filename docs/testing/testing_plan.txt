    System Testing:
        A shell script will execute the compiled program. It will reading inputs
        from a file, running the program with each set and testing the output
        against the pre-validated quadratic equation solutions.

        ensure accuracy.

    Usability Testing:
        Another team will be given access to the program and will provide
        feedback on its usability i.e. weather or not the software is easy to
