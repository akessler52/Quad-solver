1. By using the Citardauq Fromula instead of the Quadratic Formula we can minimize the error when
|4ac| is small in comparison with |b|. In this case, while using the Quadratic Formula, one of the
roots computed may suffer serious loss of precision.

	Quadratic Formula
		x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

	Citardauq Formula
		x = 2c / (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))


2. This is explained in more detail in "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating
Point Arithmatic"

Catastrophic cancellation occurs when the operands are subject to rounding errors. For example in
the quadratic formula, the expression [ b2 - 4ac ] occurs. The quantities [ b2 ] and [ 4ac ] are
subject to rounding errors since they are the results of floating-point multiplications. Suppose
that they are rounded to the nearest floating-point number, and so are accurate to within [ .5 ]
ulp. When they are subtracted, cancellation can cause many of the accurate digits to disappear,
leaving behind mainly digits contaminated by rounding error. Hence the difference might have an
error of many ulps. For example, consider [ b = 3.34 ], [ a = 1.22 ], and [ c = 2.28 ]. The exact
value of [ b2 - 4ac ] is [ .0292 ]. But [ b2 ] rounds to [ 11.2 ] and [ 4ac ] rounds to [ 11.1 ],
hence the final answer is [ .1 ] which is an error by 70 ulps, even though [ 11.2 - 11.1 ] is
exactly equal to [ .16 ]. The subtraction did not introduce any error, but rather exposed the error
introduced in the earlier multiplications.

Benign cancellation occurs when subtracting exactly known quantities. If [ x ] and [ y ] have no
rounding error, then by Theorem 2 if the subtraction is done with a guard digit, the difference
[ x-y ] has a very small relative error (less than 2).

A formula that exhibits catastrophic cancellation can sometimes be rearranged to eliminate the
problem. Again consider the quadratic formula

(4)	r1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 -4ac)) / 2a
	r2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 -4ac)) / 2a

When [ b^2 >> ac ], then [ b^2 - 4ac ] does not involve a cancellation and [ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ~= |b| ]. 
But the other addition (subtraction) in one of the formulas will have a catastrophic cancellation. To
avoid this, multiply the numerator and denominator of [ r1 ] by [ -b - sqrt(b^2 -4ac) ]
(and similarly for r2) to obtain

(5)  	r1 = 2c / (-b - sqrt(b^2 -4ac))
	r2 = 2c / (-b + sqrt(b^2 -4ac))


If [ b^2 ] and [ b > 0 ], then computing [ r1 ] using formula (4) will involve a cancellation. Therefore,
use formula (5) for computing [ r1 ] and (4) for [ r2 ]. On the other hand, if [ b < 0 ], use (4) for
computing [ r1 ] and (5) for [ r2 ].
